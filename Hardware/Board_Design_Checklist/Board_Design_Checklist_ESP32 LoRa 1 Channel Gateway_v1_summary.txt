1) Are the part libraries consistent with eagle github repo? [NO]
comment: Following devicesets are used in schematic but have not been found in the corresponding update library:

SparkFun-Aesthetics: GND, 3.3V.
SparkFun-Capacitors: 0.1UF-25V(+80/-20%)(0603).

If this is not intended, adjust the library paths or library deviceset names and update again.

2) Are the fiducials in the lower right corner? [YES]
comment: x4

3) Do all VCC connections use the VCC symbol (oriented upward)? [YES]
comment: 3.3V

4) Is the I2C address in the schematic? [YES]
comment: I2C note: I should add pullup resistors on the board

5) Is the I2C pin order correct (GND/VCC/SDA/CLK) and did you consider using a Qwiic connector? [YES]
comment: Qwiic yes

6) Is the I2C pull-up resistor isolation jumper present? [NO]
comment: Doesnt have pullups yet. Also will this apply for a master board?

7) Are active low pins labeled clearly? [NO]
comment: RST is text-only
